problems with multiple valid outputs (such as the loose ordering of Array2/EvenOdd) may reject valid solutions.

On Windows, terminals cannot print unicode characters 'U+2713'/'U+2714' (checkmark and heavy checkmark).
This including VSCode's integrated terminal. Manually changing the codepage to UTF-7 or UTF-8 (`chcp 65000`/`65001`) does not help.
Eclipse can display the character without any issue.
