generation fails for all problems in section "Map-1"
validation is nonfunctional for problems under section "Map-2", and any other problem involving a "Map" type

In the 'problems' pane, you can create a filter for these errors:
    set 'Text:' dropdown to "doesn't contain":  "This method must return"
