# LocalBat
A webscraper for <a href="https://codingbat.com">CodingBat</a> that generates Java files for local/offline use.

![VScodeHoriz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd58f18c-b7e1-48ad-b4ce-c5eac2227061)


A java file is generated for each problem on the website, organized into subdirectories by section.\
A file is generated ranking the problems by difficulty: 
<a href="https://github.com/DADMIN1/LocalBat/blob/master/savedir/difficulty_table.json">difficulty_table.json</a>.\
<a href="https://github.com/DADMIN1/LocalBat/blob/master/savedir/sitemap.json">sitemap.json</a>
file is also generated by the webscraper.\
The problem data scraped from the pages on the website is stored in .json files under: 
<a href="https://github.com/DADMIN1/LocalBat/tree/master/savedir/jsonDumps">/savedir/jsonDumps/</a>\
And the generated .java files are under:
<a href="https://github.com/DADMIN1/LocalBat/tree/master/savedir/javaFiles">/savedir/javaFiles/</a>

All of the java files can be run to validate the solution against the testcases provided on the site.

# How to setup (in Eclipse IDE)
## 1) Create a new workspace
  When you open Eclipse, simply rewrite the path in the prompt to 'localBat-workspace' or something similar.\
  It will create a directory for that workspace if it doesn't already exist.\
  You can achieve the same thing from the 'switch workspace' prompt.

## 2) Create a new java project
  Provide a name (e.g. localBat), uncheck the option to 'Create module-info.java file', then hit 'Finish'

## 3) Copy the files into the project
  Locate the 'src' directory of the newly created project. (e.g. "C:\Users\USERNAME\localBat-workspace\localBat\src\\")\
  Copy everything under:
  <a href="https://github.com/DADMIN1/LocalBat/tree/master/savedir/javaFiles">/savedir/javaFiles/</a>
  into that 'src' directory.\
  The workspace directory structure should now look like this:

## 4) Hit F5
  Go back to Eclipse and check to see if the project has been populated with the added files.\
  If not, refresh it once or twice by hitting 'F5'
