  "prompt": "Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper \"public int fixTeen(int n) {\"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. \"decomposition\"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main noTeenSum().",
