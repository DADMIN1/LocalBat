  "prompt": "We'll say that a positive int n is \"endy\" if it is in the range 0..10 or 90..100 (inclusive). Given an array of positive ints, return a new array of length \"count\" containing the first endy numbers from the original array. Decompose out a separate isEndy(int n) method to test if a number is endy. The original array will contain at least \"count\" endy numbers.",
