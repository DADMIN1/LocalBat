  "prompt": "Given two arrays, A and B, of non-negative int scores. A \"special\" score is one which is a multiple of 10, such as 40 or 90. Return the sum of largest special score in A and the largest special score in B. To practice decomposition, write a separate helper method which finds the largest special score in an array. Write your helper method after your scoresSpecial() method in the JavaBat text area.",
