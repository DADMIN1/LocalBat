  "prompt": "Given a string, count the number of words ending in 'y' or 'z' -- so the 'y' in \"heavy\" and the 'z' in \"fez\" count, but not the 'y' in \"yellow\" (not case sensitive). We'll say that a y or z is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic letter immediately following it. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is an alphabetic letter.)",
