    /* The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition. 
    The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). 
    Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, 
    so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. 
    Define a recursive fibonacci(n) method that returns the nth fibonacci number, 
    with n=0 representing the start of the sequence. */
